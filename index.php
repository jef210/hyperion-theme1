An avid outdoorsmen and master chef in his free time, Lonestar Western Beef’s founder and President, John Bachman, was persistently encouraged by numerous friends and family to turn his dabbling in the creation of venison jerky into a business that would allow the public to enjoy his amazing jerky. After retiring from the Air Force, John decided to follow the persuasions of his friends and family and his dream of owning his own company by forming Lone Star Western Beef Inc." data-trigger="focus" >

The ranch is located in the Elk River valley, which was visited by the Ute Indians annually in the summertime, because of its plentiful hunting and medicinal hot springs. Cattle were introduced to the area in 1860 thus, the beginning of Routt County’s agriculture history. In 1928 a fully operational cattle company was established at the ranch headquarters. Many winters and summers have come and gone, and Sweetwood Cattle Company still drives on the tradition." data-trigger="focus">

     <button type="button" class="btn btn-default brand-box brand-logo" id="wild-zora-logo" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="About Wild Zora: " data-content="In early 2011 our family started to learn about Gluten-Free, Paleo, and Primal food. We just didn’t feel good about feeding the typical sugary, grain-filled snacks on the market to our kids! Jerky proved no better. So many jerky snacks contain nitrites, nitrates and MSG, and all of them are just too tough and too salty. When we’re hungry, our bodies crave lasting energy: something substantial, savory, and nutritious. Nothing on the market lived up to that standard.

    Beginning in 2013, we created our own alternative. At home, we always considered meat AND vegetables a complete meal. So we started to mix and dehydrate 100% grass-fed beef from a local rancher along with fresh vegetables from our garden.  We discovered that we could make super tasty meat and veggie snacks that our family really enjoyed!

    Our kids started sharing our beef and veggie snacks with their friends at school. Soon many of our friends insisted we start a business to sell them. We listened! We now make our meat and veggie bars in our own fully USDA-certified kitchen just outside Fort Collins, Colorado." data-trigger="focus">

After all, what significance could one tiny cigarette have on the environment? Probably not much you'd think, but add up the roughly one billion smokers and 12.3 billion cigarettes that are smoked every day, the results may be surprising.

    Truth is, the tobacco industry's environmental impact reaches far beyond the cigarettes people smoke every day. That's why GreenSmartLiving has put together a visual snapshot of the true impact tobacco has on the world, from production to consumption. See it all for yourself." data-trigger="focus">
